# Announcing ETHLend Baiji Bug Bounty campaign

## Baiji Bug Bounty Campaign Conditions:

- Baiji test platform is hosted in Kovan network, all the Ethereum and tokens are for testing purpose and have no value. 
- Do not open issues for high or critical severity issues, this issues must be communicated privately by sending an email to support@ethlend.io with the title 'Baiji high severity issue'. Public disclosure of a high severity vulnerability would make it inelegible for a bounty.
- Some technical knowledge is required for the process.
- To notify the team about an issue, bug or possible improvement, first check the list of issues to ensure its not duplicated. Duplicated issues are not elegible for reward.
- If you want to add more information to an existing issue, feel free to comment in it.
- This test version has only the necessary features for lending process; translations, statitiscs and other components not required in the lending testing are not available so please dont open issues related with this, for example "Statistics sections is not working", this will be added in the final version.
- During the testing phase the application and the whole infrastructure will be updated frequently. Because of that, temporary issues that might be caused by shortage of service (i.e. inability to login, application not working ...) will not be eligible for rewards.
- Issues related with layout problems on specific devices and/or browsers (tablets/phones, safari/opera etc) are not eligible for rewards. The team is in process of testing the application with multiple browsers and devices and as such, at the time of the reward, only chrome is supported as official browser, although the application works on firefox pretty well already.
- To make testing easier, we drastically reduced the time intervals involving the loan creation and repayment process. This means that installments will be only 1 day long instead of 30, and the duration of a day will be actually 5 minutes. The collateral price for every loan will last 5 minutes and the premium phase of the loan funding will be 2 minutes.
- The team is also making their own testing process so there could exists some known bugs pending solution that are inelegible for the bounty.
- Rewards will be decided on a case by case basis and the bug bounty program, terms and conditions are at the sole discretion of Aave/ETHLend.
- Rewards will be variable depending of the severity of the issue. Other variables are taken in account for the rewards as the quality of the issue description, the instructions for reproducibility and the quality of fix.


### How to get Kovan ETH:

- First you would need to create an account in the platform, as you would need to use the in-app wallet to hold them. 
- For getting Ethereum Kovan you need to join the Kovan Fauce Gitter: https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet from there you can send in a message your Ethereum address and you will receive 3 ETH. 
- With ETH you can test most of the platform using ETH as medium when creating a loan offer and ETH as collateral when creating a loan request. For further testing you will need the different tokens available LEND, OMG, DAI, TUSD.

### How to get LEND, OMG, DAI and TUSD tokens:

- If you want to get some tokens for further testing contact us on support@ethlend.io with the 'Baiji Test Tokens' Subject and your ethereum address. You can also ask @sirsoth in our telegram or gitter channel.
